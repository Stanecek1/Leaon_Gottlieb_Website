                    <p>(Grandpa talking to his grandson, David, who has been arrested for rape.)</p>

                    <p>“The DNA tests came back positive. How can you explain the sperm test DNA? How do you explain your blood in her apartment — where you told me you’ve never been?” Jabbing his finger at David. “You’ve been jerking me around. You would let me walk you into the courtroom and watch you get trampled by the stampede of questions the prosecutor would ask!” </p>
                    
                    <p>Fred backed away two steps. “WHAT THE HELL’S WRONG WITH YOU?”</p>

                    <p>Rising from his seat. “THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE,” David shouted back. “I can’t explain it! I’m telling you I haven’t touched her in a long time.”</p>

                    <p>“DON’T BULLSHIT ME,” Fred shouted, getting right in David’s space. “There are three people you never lie to, your doctor, your attorney, and your grandfather. To do so could have dire consequences.”</p>

                    <p>“Grandpa, I’m not lying.”</p>

                    <p>“How stupid do you think I am? I may be getting old, but I still know how a guy’s sperm gets into a girl’s vagina. Since your sperm can only come from one place, what do you expect me to believe? Either you had consensual sex with her, or you raped her. Wake up. This isn’t a game!” Now eye to eye, “WHICH WAS IT?”</p>
                
                    <p>With a downtrodden look, on the verge of tears, David said, “I didn’t rape her or even touch her for three months before her claim of rape.”</p>

                    <p>“So, explain how your DNA got where it was found?”</p>

                    <p>In a defeated tone, hands held high in the air, in a surrender position, “I can’t.”</p>

                    <p><strong>“Stop bullshitting me.”</strong></p>

                    <p>“Grandpa, I would never lie to you. I’m baffled, but I didn’t rape her, and I didn’t have sex with her. I don’t know where the evidence came from, but I didn’t put it where it was found.</p>

                <h1 class="text-center">Homeless</h1>
                <div class="mx-5">
                    <p>The novel Homeless depicts the lives of seven people from birth through life. Each is selected by the fickle finger of fate and cast into homelessness. Each story is as unique as their names and each will evoke feelings in you which will change the way you view homeless people.</p>

                    <h2>Rose’s Story</h2>

                    <p><i>(Rose’s story starts with what she learned of her birth.) </i></p>

                    <p>“They tell me I was found at the Tenderloin Police Station, in a box with a note saying, ‘Please take good care of this child.’ They estimated I was less than two days old. That’s as much as I know of my parentage.” </p>           

                    <p>Rose looked at the ceiling in deep thought. “You know, I’m sure my mother loved me! She left that note and a red rose. The policeman who found me started calling me Rose, and they say the name just stuck. I never could find my mother, even when I hired a private detective. There wasn’t a clue as to who she was or why she had to leave me. Not being able to find her has plagued me, but the love reflected in the note and the rose tell me there must have been a compelling reason.”</p>

                    <h2>Kenny Carter’s Story</h2>

                    <p><i>Kenny’s story starts with his dissent into homelessness but reverts to his birth and his assent to the good life. The ending will pleasantly surprise you.</i></p>

                    <p>“Kenny, tell me the story of how you came to be living on the streets.” Kenny nodded, looked down at the floor, and hesitated, in deep contemplation. His face contorted and his fists clenched, his head rising as he said, “It’s been a long time, and I still can’t believe I did that to Patty and the kids.” The tears flowed freely. </p>           

                    <p>Regaining his composure, he went on. “The police found me lying in the roadway of Las Vegas Boulevard, drunk out of my mind. My suit was torn, and I was broke in more ways than one.” Tears filled his eyes again as he continued, “I had gambled away all our money, I was an alcoholic, I had lost my job, my car, the kid’s college funds, and the Mafia was threatening me over the $25,000 I owed them. Patty, my wife, had thrown me out.”</p>
                
                    <p>The room filled with silence as Kenny sat back remembering the darkest days of his life. Looking up with a puzzled look on his face, he said. “I’m sorry, it’s tough to look at yourself and see what a despicable person you became. I didn’t mean to …”</p>

                    <p>“It’s Okay, ‘It’s important to relive the darkest days of your life and it helps in the healing process. As for me, your feelings are an important part of the story. I only hope I can properly convey them in the book.’”</p>

                    <p>“Well, I’m not sure if that’s the beginning or the end of my story. I guess it depends on your perspective.”</p>

                    <h2>Anna Bell’s Story</h2>

                    <p><i>(David on a  cross country summer trip to enroll in college picked up Anna Bell escaping from an abusive father and employer while hitching from Mississippi to California. They made many stops visiting the parks and getting to know each other as their journey progressed. David slept outside giving Anna Bell the bed in the van.)</i></p>

                    <p>“Anna Bell lay in bed, all the wonders of the day playing over in her mind. What compelled the artists to create the petroglyphs? Obviously, there was more than one artist. Maybe it was their way of leaving notes for those who would follow, just as we leave books. </p>
                
                    <p>“How could I tell David that my father is an abusive alcoholic? I’m so ashamed, but how do I duck the questions about my past? A longing came over her. She missed being with David, and he had just gone outside. She decided she would go into more detail about how poor they were.</p>
                
                    <p class="text-center">***</p>

                    <p><i>(David tossed and turned, thinking about Anna Bell.) </i></p>

                    <p>“She was amazing and made his heart beat faster. He had trouble envisioning the poverty of her family. He lived in an ivory tower, lacked nothing, and was totally oblivious to the poverty which existed. </p>

                    <p>“Her smile makes me melt. She’s smarter than most people I know. She has an insatiable desire to learn and the ability to figure things out. It’s what we call common sense, so lacking in most people I know. What a shame she had to drop out of school.</p>

                    <p>“There’s something about her father that troubles her to no end. I could see it on her face when I asked about him. Through it all, she came out as the wonderful person she is. David couldn’t help but wonder if his feeling for her was love. He had dated since Jr. High but never felt like this. He didn’t even want to leave her side to go out to sleep. </p>
                
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>There are four more stories, each just as gripping.</strong></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <h1 class="text-center">Hysteria</h1>
                <div class="mx-5">
                    <p>(Hysteria is the story of a small-town doctor, the leading citizen of his community, suddenly drawn into the Hysteria created by the McMillon cases and its national publicity. I n the flash of an eye, the idyllic life of the doctor and his family is turned upside down.)</p>

                    <p>“As he viewed the headline, his knees felt like they were giving way, and he was in danger of collapsing. It took all his concentration to remain erect. He could feel his blood pressure reaching new heights. With a great deal of effort, he managed to get to the doctor’s lounge and sit down. Ignoring the paper, he concentrated on relaxing, lowering his blood pressure and heart rate.</p>                
                    
                    <p>“After what seemed to be an eternity, his head stopped pounding, and he felt he could read the story.”</p>

                    <p><strong>‘Dr. DeMarco accused of Pedophilia.</strong></p>

                    <p>A young girl has accused Doctor DeMarco of sodomizing her with an instrument, fondling her in the genital area, taking her to Voodoo rituals, and having sex with her. With shades of the McMartin case it would appear that pedophiles are not only found in California and pre-schools. We have our own, right here in Monticello, using the guise of a doctor to gain access to our children. I’m sure there are more accusations that have not yet come forward. The good doctor is more interested in satisfying his depraved sexual needs than caring for our children. We must be more diligent in the future to protect our children from the evil which exists all around us.’</p>

                    <p>‘His blood pressure increased again and the pounding returned to his head. He tried to get up but couldn’t.</p>

                    <p>‘Dr. DeMarco sat there trying to figure out how his world had turned to shit in the few minutes it took him to read the lead story in the paper.</p>
                    
                    <p>“Who’s accusing me? Who the hell is claiming I had sex with a child? What the hell are their references to sodomy, and what fondling are they accusing me of?</p>

                    <p>“His mind ran wild. I’m ruined. With one uncaring, unconcerned accusation, I go from one of the region’s most respected citizens to a depraved pedophile. How could it happen? How could that son-of-a-bitch of a reporter write the story without consulting me? How could the editor allow it to be published without at least asking me to comment?</p>
