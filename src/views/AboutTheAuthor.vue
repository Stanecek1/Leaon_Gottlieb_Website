            <p>Leon was raised in the country atmosphere of Rock Hill, New York, in the Catskill mountains. He lived a quiet life in the winters and an active life when the crowds came up for the summer. His childhood and teen years were spent in the rural setting where fishing and hunting were right out the door. From age four he said he was going to be an attorney. He was captain of the swimming team and the tennis team in high school. His desire to win was evident in many school records. and three county records he held. Four days after graduating high school he entered the army. </p>

            <p class="me-5">Attending Pace University set the stage for Leon’s entry to St. John’s Law School, where he made Law Review and graduated as one of the top students in his class. 
              He obtained a position with one of the large Wall Street brokerage houses. His desire to try cases, had the other members of the legal team betting he would lose the next one, based on the odds ‘you can’t keep winning.’ He did. As one of the few attorneys who understood the legal end of the brokerage business, at age 28 he was named general counsel of one of the world’s largest stock brokerage firms. Haunted by the three hour a day commute to Wall Street, and finding himself running down the street, he asked himself the question: “Why am I running, I’m going for lunch!”
            </p>
            <p class="me-5">In search of a better way of life, Leon resigned his position, and moved his young family to California where he represented many of the Wall St. brokerage houses as a trial attorney. After eighteen years of loving his law practice with a success rate of 90% +, boredom set in.</p>

            <p>In 1979 Leon started a computer company to monitor, control and vend copies on copy machines. That company developed the “University One-Card System,” which over the years grew to provide students on college and university campuses with the ability to use a photo ID card for every campus function. As a debit card, the system handled all purchases on and even off campus. The same card provided controlled entry to residences, classes, elevators, parking and events acting as a card key.  Food plans, food, books and other cash purchases, as well as security filled all the needs of the campuses. The company was sold to a public company in 2007  and continues to provide for the needs of numerous college and university campuses.</p>
